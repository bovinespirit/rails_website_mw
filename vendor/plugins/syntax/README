SyntaxHighlight Plugin
======================

Adds a helper method to syntax highlight code.  It applies textilize and
sanitize during the process.
Sample stylesheet in the stylesheets/ directory.

Implementation is still in flux, but it's usable in its current form.

Example:

<%= syntax_highlight(text) %>

* Use RedCloth 3.0.3 for best results *
