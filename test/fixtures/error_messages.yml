rger_error:
  id: 3
  error: "RgER"
  name: "Rotating Gobo Time-Out"
  short_description: "The rotating gobo wheel rotation's magnetic indexing circuit has malfunctioned."
  long_description: "The unit detects the position of the wheel by waiting for a signal from a magnetic sensor which
  detects a magnet that is mounted on the wheel.  If the magnet has fallen out, the sensor is broken, the connection
  between the sensor and the motherboard is broken, the wheel is not aligned or the wheel is not rotating properly then
  it detects an error.  It looks for a signal while the unit is working, not just during reset.  To align the wheel
  power up the unit and let it reset, then push the wheel round.  It will go round in obvious steps.  On one of these
  steps the magnet should fall underneath the senser.  If it doesn't loosen off the wheel, move it round then tighten it
  again."
